# House-Price-Data-Analysis
This a self imporvement project, where i analysed the data used here to draw correlations between columns and drew deductions from the plots/values.

-First i checked if there is any relations between sale_number of a house and the average price sold in each one
-Secondly i checked if there is any relations between the when the house was first listed for sale and the price it was sold for 
adding some deductions
-Third i checked if there was any correlations to the number of bedrooms a house has compared to the price it was sold for 
then deduced some possiblites as to why the data is the way it is.
-fourth was that if there was any correlations between the submarket,square foot available in a house ,and it sale price to use multi columns data analysis.
